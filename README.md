A high-performance Python package for parallel processing and optimization, designed to accelerate CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks. HyperProcess provides seamless integration with NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn while offering both thread-based and process-based parallelism.

## 🚀 Features

- **CPU-bound parallelism**: Efficient management of CPU-intensive tasks using ProcessPool
- **I/O-bound parallelism**: Streamlined I/O operations using ThreadPool
- **Task queues**: Advanced task management and synchronization
- **Library acceleration**: Optimized support for NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn
- **Flexible integration**: Extensible architecture for various libraries

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install hyperprocess
```

or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HyperProcess.git
cd HyperProcess
pip install .
```

## 🔧 Usage

### Basic Example

```python
# CPU-bound tasks
from hyperprocess.core.cpu.compute import compute_task
result = compute_task(data)

# I/O-bound tasks
from hyperprocess.core.io.streams import io_task
result = io_task(data)
```

### Thread and Process Pools

```python
# ThreadPool Example
from hyperprocess.pool.threadpool import ThreadPool

with ThreadPool() as pool:
    results = pool.map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# ProcessPool Example
from hyperprocess.pool.processpool import ProcessPool

with ProcessPool() as pool:
    results = pool.map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

### Library Integration

```python
from hyperprocess.integration.numpy_accel import accelerated_function
import numpy as np

data = np.array([1, 2, 3])
result = accelerated_function(data)
```
